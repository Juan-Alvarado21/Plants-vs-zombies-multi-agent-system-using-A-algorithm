# Plants-vs-zombies-multi-agent-system-using-A-algorithm
This program, based on Plants vs. Zombies, simulates the problem of the sample-collecting robot (multi-agent system) proposed to be addressed using the A* informed search algorithm. In this system, samples are found and grouped into clusters, using crumbs to trace the path back to the ship, and the collaboration between agents is described.
