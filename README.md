# Plants-vs-zombies-multi-agent-system-using-A-algorithm
This program based on plants vs zombies simulates the problem of the sample collecting robot (multi-agent system) proposed to be carried out with the A* informed search algorithm where the samples will be found and grouped into clusters, using crumbs to trace the path to the ship. and describe the collaboration between agents.
